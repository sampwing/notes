\section{Past Work}
\subsection{Sarcasm}
Sarcasm is common in opinionated user generated content, blog posts among others.\cite{icwsm} Does this also apply to forums data?  Would determining if a post was highly opinionated before trying to classify it lead to better results?
\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}
There is a pretty comprehensive overview on the current state of the art challenges of opnion mining and sentiment analysis by pang\cite{pang}

\subsection{Narrative Schemas}
Information regarding narrative schemas\cite{chambers:schemas}

Event Chains\cite{chambers:eventchains} are a set ${e_1, ... , e_n}$ of events acted out by a protagonist, where n is the size of the set, and relation $B(e_i, e_j)$ means that $e_i$ occurs before $e_j$ where $i<j$

narrative coherence : verbs sharing coreferring arguments are semantically connected by virtue of narrative discourse structure.

narrative chains only have a partial ordering of events, due to the fact that they only deal with actions by a certain protagonist.


\subsection{Persuasion}
Anderson's paper on integration theory\cite{anderson:integrationtheory}

Davie's Paper on Dogmatism\cite{davies:dogmatism}

Devine's Paper on Jury Decision Making\cite{devine:jury}

Petty's Paper on personal involvement\cite{petty:personalinvolvement}
